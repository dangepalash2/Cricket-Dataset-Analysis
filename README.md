In cricket, the prediction has become one of the most interesting things nowadays. The researchers use different methods such as linear regression, Naive Bayes, K nearest neighbor, and other machine learning algorithms to predict final run-rate, which team will win in bilateral, triangular and World Cup matches, and what will be the final score of a team batting first. Prediction always adds value for team authors, coaches, and management to instruct the players and also making strategies. A playerâ€™s performance has a dependency on various constraints such as venue, whether it is an in-house or abroad game, how is the current form, what is record against the opposition, how big the boundaries are, etc. This project will predict how many runs a player will score in the current match. To predict the number of runs, Multiple Regression has been used.
